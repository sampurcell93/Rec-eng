# Recommendation Engine
## Goals
The goal of this engine was to explore solutions like collaborative filtering, content based filtering, and a hybrid of the two. 
We used MongoDB and Node.js in order to get up and running quickly, and have eschewed the use of a traditional login system here.
We originally built an app in Rails, but this became unwieldy and the framework became more of a hindrance for testing than a helpful environment.
